# Sentiment-Analysis
Intro to NLP Course Project

# Description
Sentiment analysis is a challenging subject in machine learning. People
express their emotions in language that is often obscured by sarcasm,
ambiguity, and plays on words, all of which could be very misleading for
both humans and computers. In this project, we apply different machine
learning models to predict sentiments of IMDB movie reviews.

# Motivation
This project is inspired by a Kaggle challenge, the reason why we think
itâ€™s a great choice for final project for Intro to NLP are:

We will be practicing basic NLP techniques such as reading the
data, data cleaning and text preprocessing. We will also be
playing with Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and NLTK.
We will have the opportunities to get to know and apply
frequently-used machine learning models such as Random
Forest, Naive Bayes and Word2vec, which introduces us to hot
topics in Machine Learning and Deep Learning areas.

# Data set:
The labeled data set consists of 50,000 IMDB movie reviews, specially
selected for sentiment analysis. The sentiment of reviews is binary,
meaning the IMDB rating < 5 results in a sentiment score of 0, and
rating >=7 have a sentiment score of 1. No individual movie has more
than 30 reviews. The 25,000 review labeled training set does not
include any of the same movies as the 25,000 review test set. In
addition, there are another 50,000 IMDB reviews provided without any
rating labels.
